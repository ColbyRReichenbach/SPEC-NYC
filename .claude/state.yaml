# Data Model Design (2026-01-17):
# - property_id: BBL + apartment for unique identification
# - Sales history: sale_sequence, is_latest_sale, price_change_pct
# - Segmentation: SINGLE_FAMILY, WALKUP, ELEVATOR, SMALL_MULTI
# - Price tiers: entry, core, premium, luxury (within-segment)
#
# Model Strategy (per Zillow/Redfin research):
# - V1.0: Single global model with segment features
# - V2.0: Segment-specific models if variance >15%
